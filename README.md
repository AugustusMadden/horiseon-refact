# horiseon-refact

## Description

This build helped to drill the basics of HTML and CSS, and how the fundamentals of each language feed into the performance of its counterpart. The refactor aimed to reorganize the existing structure of the code, eliminate extraneous or unnessecary elements, and improve interaction with semantic HTML for improved SEO and accessability.

Finding what to fix was easy, but if I didn't keep track of what I was doing I'd waste time trying to fix something I did. I spent twenty minuetes trying to fix a problem with the "benefit" section going out of alignment because I didn't properly cut and paste "section" into where I was replacing div tags.
